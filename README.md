# DQNSuite
DQNSuite is a simple, and easy-to-use Python GUI interface tool that brings the power of Reinforcement Learning models into the palm of the user's hand. 

Use the simple GUI interface to create and optimize your own Reinforcement Learning agents in a matter of seconds.

## Algorithms supported:

TD3 (continuous spaces only)\
SAC (continuous spaces only)\
DDPG (continuous spaces only)\
PPO\
DQN (discrete spaces only)\
SAC

## Environments supported:

MountainCar (very easy)\
CartPole (easy)\
Pendulum (medium)\
Acrobot (hard)\
LunarLander (very hard)

## Installation

The entire GUI can run in Python, and requires the following libraries installed to function:

tkinter (pre-installed with Python
customtkinter\
swig\
gym\
stable-baselines3

You can install all of these by running this command:
```
pip install customtkinter==5.2.2 swig==4.2.1 stable_baselines3==2.3.2 gym[box2d]==0.11
```
## Compatibility

The code was tested on Python 3.12, but should probably work on some older versions as well.
